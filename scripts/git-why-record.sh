#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Usage: git-why-record.sh [path]
#
# Coverage check, not a lookup: walks commit history from newest to oldest
# and reports every commit newer than the most recent one that already has a
# reasoning note attached -- "the gap" since notes were last kept up to date.
#
# Purely mechanical: no AI, no note generation, no side effects. Answers "are
# we behind on notes?" -- distinct from git-why.sh ("what's the reasoning for
# this file/line?") and git-notes-grep.sh ("which commit has a note about
# this concept?").
#
# With no argument, walks the whole current branch. Pass a path to scope the
# walk to commits touching that file/directory instead.
#
# Notes are read via `git log`'s own %N format placeholder, joined with each
# commit in the same walk -- no separate `git notes list` call, no bash-side
# set-building. The walk stops at the first noted commit it finds, so on a
# repo with no notes fetched at all, this still reads the full history (there
# is nothing to stop early on), but does it in one `git log` process rather
# than forking git once per commit.
